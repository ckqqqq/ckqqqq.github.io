I am currently a undergraduate in Beijing University of Posts And Telecommunications (BUPT) [[link]](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/).
In the past 2 years, my main research topics are about the emotional support dialog system, some of them has been applied to the mental patients [[link]](TODOLink).
I am also interested in the theories and mechanisms of interactions among Large Language Models (LLM), such as swarm intelligence, self-supervised learning, and LLM alignment.
I have published some papers . You can download\preview my papers at here [[link]](TODOLINK).
