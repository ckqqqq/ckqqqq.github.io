      Fig. 2: An overview of STDS. Our system operates recursively, meaning that in each turn of dialog, it goes through a whole generation process. The generation process consists of a two-stage framework in which the domain-specific LLM and foundational LLM collaborate to vote, revise, and regenerate each other's outputs. In the t th turn of the dialogue, the model takes the user input, generates a response guided by the strategy in the (t-1) th turn, and then revises the strategy for the (t+1) th generation.
